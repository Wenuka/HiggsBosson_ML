# Machine learning Project 1

* Wenuka Gunarathne
* Aur√©lien Balice-Debbas
* Giorgio Savini

## Structure

We have provided the foloving files and folders:

* scripts 
	* helpers.py : Helper functions for cleaning, finding parameters and utility functions (gradient,   mean square error....). Needed for run.py and implementation.py
	* run.py : Containing the executable to produce our best predictions.
	* implementations.py : The implementation of the requested functions.

* data : ** Not included as the file is large, please add this before running the code **
	* train.csv : CSV containing training data
	* test.csv : CSV containing the test data

* Project_structure.ipynb
* report.pdf : The final report

* README.md. : This readme file

scripts/run.py produce the best prediction in a file called best_predictions.csv

** NB **  : It takes a long time to run. 

## Requirments

You need to have folowing requirments to run this code smoothly,

* Python 3.5+
* Python numpy package
* Python csv package 
* Python tqdm package (only used for visualization (for progressbar))

## Results

You can find the final predictions in the ./data/best_predictions.csv file
